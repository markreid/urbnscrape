# URBNSCRAPE

CLI tool for finding available spots at my local wave pool.

## Why?

The wave pool is really popular, so most of the time it's booked out well in advance. The UI for booking a session lets you choose a date, but then you can only iterate one day at a time forward or backward to try and find a free session. Most of the time I just want to be able to quickly find the next available session.

This tool has two modes:

- Iterate days until you find an available session
- Display availability for all sessions for X days

## Usage

```
# needs node 12.18+ for native ESM support
npm i
npm start
```

## Note

If you're the API owner and you don't like me doing this, reach out and let me know. I've got some ideas about how you can improve your interface ;)
